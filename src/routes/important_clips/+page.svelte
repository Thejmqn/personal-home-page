        <h3>Talking about SHARKS!</h3>
        <p>Yes, the full capitalization and exclamation mark are necessary. A great video by CGP Grey describing an obscure legal battle between a liberatarian organization and a London borough. A random ten minute talk about two groups who don't even know the video is being made about them - exactly what the Internet is all about.</p>
